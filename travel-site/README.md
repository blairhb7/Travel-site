<h1>ABOUT</h1>
<h3> “The world is a book, and those who do not travel read only one page.”</h3>
<h4. The Goal</h4>
<P> Travel life was built as travel blog to help world travelers descover their next destination! Each destination gives a beautiful image of the location along with a description. We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be able to do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple months traveling this beautiful planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. You might feel like you’re stuck in a rut in your daily life. Or you’re yearning for something exciting and different.</p>
